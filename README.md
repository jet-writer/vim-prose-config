## Prose Config for vim

If you have a clean vim environment you want to use to write prose this simple configuration is all you need to get started from a \*nix system.

## Quick start

### Install

1. Run the `setup.sh` script.
1. When the vim window opens type :PlugInstall
1. You're ready to write.

### Use

Technically you don't have to do anything else. A lot of quality of life improvements are made for you to make it easier to start writing. 

The real treat though is the distraction free environment. Type `:Iawriter` from normal mode in vim to toggle a distraction free writing mode on. Repeat to shut it off.

## Features

- Improvements to the default UI
- A simple status line at the bottom of the screen
- Use Ctl and the vim keys (hjkl) to switch between panes
- j and k obeys visual wrapping
- Undo one sentence at a time instead of everything since mode switch.
- Automatically install vim-plug if it's not installed
- Automatically install plugins that are not already installed on launch
- Install iawriter and it's dependencies for focus mode.
- Install vimwiki for notes and world building.

## Next steps

This is really just a starting point. As you dive deeper into vim customize the .vimrc file to suit your needs.
