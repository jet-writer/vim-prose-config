# Prose Config for vim

If you have a clean vim environment you want to use to write prose this simple configuration is all you need to get started from a \*nix system.

## Quick start

### Install

1. Run the `setup.sh` script.
1. You're ready to write in vim. Use the `:Iawriter` command in normal mode to toggle distraction free mode.

## Features

- Use Ctl and the vim keys (hjkl) to switch between panes
- j and k uses visual wrapping
- Undo one sentence at a time instead of everything since mode switch
- Improvements to the default UI
- Automatically install vim-plug if it's not installed
- Automatically install plugins that are not already installed on launch
- Install iawriter and it's dependencies for focus mode
- Install vimwiki for notes and world building

## Next steps

This is really just a starting point. As you dive deeper into vim customize the .vimrc file to suit your needs.
